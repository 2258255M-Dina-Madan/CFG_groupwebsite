    <h3> How to power our world without damaging it</h3>
    <h4>By: Rebecca <h4>

<!-- The main body of the article -->

    <p class = "paragraph" > Green energy is that which comes from renewable sources - those that are naturally replenished as opposed to fossil fuels which are a finite resource that take millions of years to develop and will continue to diminish with use. Renewable energy sources also have a much smaller impact on the environment than fossil fuels, which produce pollutants such as greenhouse gases as a by-product, contributing to climate change. Gaining access to fossil fuels typically requires either mining or drilling deep into the earth, often in ecologically sensitive locations. Green energy, however, utilizes energy sources that are readily available all over the world, including in rural and remote areas that don'totherwise have access to electricity. Advances in renewable energy technologieshave lowered the cost of solar panels, wind turbines and other sources of green energy, placing the ability to produce electricity in the hands of the people ratherthan those of oil, gas, coal and utility companies. Green energy can replace fossilfuels in all major areas of use including electricity, water heating, home appliances, and fuel for motor vehicles. </p>
    <p class = "paragraph" > Here are six of the most common renewable sources of energy: </p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Solar power </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Solar power is typically produced using photovoltaic cells, which capture sunlight and turn it into electricity. </p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Wind power </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Air flow on the earth's surface can be used to push turbines, with stronger winds producing more energy.</p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Hydropower </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Hydropower is generated by the Earth's water cycle, including evaporation, rainfall, tides and the force of water running through a dam. Hydropower depends on high precipitation levels to produce significant amounts of energy. </p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Geothermal energy </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Just under the earth's crust are massive amounts of thermal energy,which originates from both the original formation of the planet and the radioactive decay of minerals. Geothermal energy in the form ofhot springs has been used by humans for millennia for bathing, and now it's being used to generate electricity.</p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Biomass </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Recently-living natural materials like wood waste, sawdust and combustible agricultural wastes can be converted into energy with far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum-based fuel sources.</p>
        <p class = "paragraph" id = "para_heading" > Biofuels </p>
        <p class = "paragraph"> Rather than burning biomass to produce energy, sometimes these renewable organic materials are transformed into fuel. Notable examples include ethanol and biodiesel. Biofuels have the potential to meet more than 25 percent of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050, up from two percent in 2010</p>
